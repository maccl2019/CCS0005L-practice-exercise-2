## Exercise 1 (EXERCISE-1.cpp)

```txt
Make a program that has four user-defined functions consisting the arraysubscript(), arrayname(),subscriptnotation() and offsetnotation() that will output each elements in different methods. Main function must only contain all the functions being called and nothing else more.
```

## Exercise 2 (EXERCISE-2.cpp)

```txt
Make a program that will ask for the number of rows and column to output a two-dimensional array using pointers. The program must contains two user-defined function called multimdimensional() to enter the elements of rows and columns and result() to output the two-dimensioanal array.
```

## Exercise 3 (EXERCISE-3.cpp)

```txt
Make a program that will determine the fibonacci at the desired position number using recursion. 
```

## Exercise 4 (EXERCISE-4.cpp)

```txt
Make a program that will determine if the entered string is a palindrome or not using the recursion. Make sure it accepts space and uppercase letter.
```

## Exercise 5 (EXERCISE-5.cpp)

```txt
Make a program that will convert decimal number to binary using recursion.
```
