/** NOTE
 * UPDATE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/936687/how-do-i-declare-a-2d-array-in-c-using-new
 * There *is* a way to do it:
 * 
 * @Mehrdad Afshari (https://stackoverflow.com/users/33708/mehrdad-afshari):
 * int** a = new int*[rowCount];
 * for(int i = 0; i < rowCount; ++i)
 *     a[i] = new int[colCount];
 * 
 * Leaving my original answer as a comment.
 * 
 * The thing is, there is no actual way to declare
 * a 2D array dynamically (UPDATE, there is - look at note above)
 * but understanding the way a table works, we can do a workaround:
 * 
 * Think of this as a 3x4 table:
 * +-----+-----+-----+-----+
 * |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |
 * +-----+-----+-----+-----+
 * |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |
 * +-----+-----+-----+-----+
 * |   9 |  10 |  11 |  12 |
 * +-----+-----+-----+-----+
 * 
 * It has a size of 3x4 cells, or 12 cells in total
 * Since declaring a 2D array would not be possible,
 * we can instead declare it as a normal array like this:
 * int arr[12] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}
 * Since we know that we have four numbers per row,
 * we can denote them in code instead, so that everytime
 * we hit a multiple of 4, we treat it as a new row.
 * int arr[12] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}
 *                ^ Row 1     ^ Row 2     ^ Row 3
 * 
 * Additionally, saving them would be easy - we just add them
 * sequentially. Accessing them is as easy by multiplying
 * the row and column of the data you want to access.
 * Just make sure to account 0 as the first row and column
 * of the data.
 *
